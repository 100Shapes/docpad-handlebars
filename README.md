# Docpad-Handlebars

## Objective
Create a Docpad app which rendered its views using Handlebar templates so that the same templates could be shared by a frontend JS app.

## Getting setup
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/100Shapes/docpad-handlebars.git`
- Install the dependencies `cd docpad-handlebars && npm install`
- Run the app `docpad run`

## Running the app
- [Launch the app](http://localhost:9778/home.html)
- Note the line of text
- Turn JavaScript off in the browser and refresh
- Docpad renders the same template

## Special Sauce
Due to the [Docpad Handlebars plugin](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-handlebars), we're actually precompiling the Handlebars templates for the browser.
